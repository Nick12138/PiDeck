 * tracker; the pool's busy-change signal plus this snapshot diff is the only
 * seam the renderer has.
 *
 * The first snapshot primes the baseline silently: unacknowledged markers
 * that already exist (app start, renderer reload) were visible through the
 * sidebar badges before this observer existed and must not replay as alerts.
 * Afterwards, every NEW terminal generation for a non-active workspace becomes
 * a candidate while the window is in the background. The active workspace is
 * always skipped — its completions already flow through the event-stream
 * tracker, and double-delivering them would duplicate every foreground alert.
